[ About ]

SunVox is a powerful modular synthesizer and pattern-based sequencer (tracker): http://www.warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox
SunVox Library is the main part of the SunVox engine without a graphical interface.
Using this library, you can do the following:
 * load and play several SunVox/XM/MOD music files simultaneously;
 * play interactive/generative/microtonal music;
 * play synths, apply effects;
 * load samples (WAV,AIFF,XI), synths and effects created by other users (some of these modules are distributed along with the SunVox);
 * change any project parameters (synth controllers, pattern notes, etc.).
